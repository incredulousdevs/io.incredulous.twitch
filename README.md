# Twitch IRC for Unity

This is a lightweight [Twitch.tv IRC](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/) chat client for Unity.

Twitch IRC for Unity allows you to integrate Twitch chat with your Unity projects. This solution uses a WebSocket connection to send and receive messages to and from Twitch's IRC server.

**Note:** Only normal chat messages are currently supported. Whispers, subscriber messages, etc are not implemented. Unity WebGL is not supported.

## Installation

Twitch IRC for Unity can be installed via the package manager. You can install the package directly from its GitHub URL, or from your local disk by downloading the package.

## Requirements
1. Twitch Account
2. Twitch OAuth token (You can generate one at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

## Quick Start

1. Create a new empty GameObject and add the **TwitchController** component
2. In the inspector, enter your Twitch login information (Username, Channel, Token)
3. Make sure that "Connect on Start" is checked in the inspector and hit Playâ€“ you should see a successful `[JOIN]` message in your Unity Console!

To start handling chat messages, use the inspector to add a listener to the TwitchController's **ChatMessageEvent**. The listener will receive a **ChatMessage** object, which contains informaton about the chat message such as the message itself and the username of the sender.
